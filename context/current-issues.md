Fix the drag and drop functionality.

Read the current canvas component code in `components/editor`

Issues to look for and document:

DRAG AND DROP ISSUES:

- Canvas nodes from the node panel cannot be dragged and dropped onto the canvas. Investigate fix the full drag-and-drop pipeline:
- Confirm that draggable nodes in the node panel have the correct draggable attribute and onDragStart handler that sets the node type in dataTransfer
- Confirm that the canvas has onDragOver (with preventDefault to allow dropping) and onDrop handlers wired up correctly
- Ensure the drop handler reads the node type from dataTransfer, calculates the correct canvas coordinates accounting for pan offset and zoom scale, and creates a new node at the dropped position
- Check that no parent element is intercepting or blocking the drag events before they reach canvas

Nodes can be dragged from the node panel and dropped onto the canvas correctly
