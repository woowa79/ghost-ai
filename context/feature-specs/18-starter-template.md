Add a small starter template library so users can start a canvas from a pre-built diagram instead of building from scratch.

## Implementation

1. Create `components/editor/starter-templates.ts`.

   Include:
   - a ` CanvasTemplate type 
   - a `CANVAS TENPLATES array
   - at least three templates, such as microservices, CI/CD pipeline, and event-driven system 

   Each template should include: 
   - `id`
   - `name`
   - `description` 
   - nodes 
   - edges

Use the shared canvas types and existing node color palette. Add small helper functions if needed to keep the template data readable.

2. Create `components/editor/starter-templates-modal.tsx`.

   The modal should: 
   - open as a dialog 
   - show template cards in a scrollable grid 
   - show the template name and description
   - include an import button for each template 
   - call `onImport` with the selected template, then close

3. Add a simple diagram preview to each template card. 
   - fit the preview to a fixed-size viewport 
   - calculate the preview bounds from the template node positions 
   - draw edges as simple lines between node centers 
   - draw nodes using their shape and color data 
   - keep the preview lightweight, no React Flow instance needed
