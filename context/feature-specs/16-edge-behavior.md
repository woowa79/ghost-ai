Replace the default canvas edges with custom edges that feel easier 
to follow, easier to click, and support inline labels.

## Implementation

1. Add connection handles to every node. 
  - place handles on the top, right, bottom, and left sides 
  - users should be able to connect from any handle to any other handle 
  - keep the handles subtle: small white dots with a dark border 
  - hide them by default and fade them in when hovering the node

2. Add a default style for new edges. 
  - use a light stroke with rounded ends 
  - add an arrowhead at the end of each edge 
  - make new connections use the custom canvas edge renderer

3. Create the custom edge renderer. 
  - use clean right-angle routing 
  - keep edges slightly dimmed at rest 
  - brighten edges when hovered or selected 
  - make edges easier to hover and click without     increasing the visible Line thickness

4. Add inline edge label editing.
  - double-click an edge to edit its label 
  - use React Flow's `EdgeLabelRenderer` and the path    midpoint coordinates from `getSmoothStepPath` to position the label - do not calculate midpoint position manually 
  - use an input that qrows  with the label text
